This is a Behavior Pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that removes beds from the game.
I got the idea to create this from this video: https://youtu.be/netOt6_D-W4?si=7HeoFt2zaTFUS_mD
Please watch it in it's entirety as I find it to be a good video essay about beds in Minecraft.

Installing this behavior pack will _not_ remove or disable phantoms or the insomnia mechanic.

Follow the steps below to disable phantoms and the insomnia mechanic per world:
  Open Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
  Go to Create New World or edit an existing world’s settings.
  Under Game settings, find the "Do Insomnia" toggle (it’s usually under the "Spawn" or "World Options" section).
  Turn "Do Insomnia" OFF. This stops phantoms from spawning due to lack of sleep.
  Create or save the world.
